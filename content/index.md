# Tolkien Fan Club

**I like Tolkien**. Read my [first post here](/majesty)

> "I am in fact a Hobbit in all but size. I like gardens, trees, and unmechanized farmlands; I smoke a pipe, and like good plain food (unrefrigerated), but detest French cooking; I like, and even dare to wear in these dull days, ornamental waistcoats. I am fond of mushrooms (out of a field); have a very simple sense of humor (which even my appreciative critics find tiresome); I go to bed late and get up late (when possible). I do not travel much."

## Reasons I like Tolkien

* You can spend years studying the legendarium and still not understand its depths
* It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike
* Disney *didn't ruin it*
* It created an entirely new genre of fantasy

1. Gandalf
2. Bilbo
3. Sam
4. Glorfindel
5. Galadriel
6. Elrond
7. Thorin
